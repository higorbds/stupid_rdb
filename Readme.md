# Stupid Ruby Database
This is a stupid, horrible and non-performative database written in ruby, for study and learn Ruby and SQL.
Inspired from [fabio akita video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7nISfpofec).

## Functions Implemented:
- select
- from
- order_by
- insert

## Getting Started:
To getting started with stupid ruby database, you've been installed [ruby](https://www.ruby-doc.org) and [bundle](https://bundler.io/).

Clone this git repo: ```git clone https://www.github.com/higorbds/stupid_rdb```
And then:
